Implemented a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system for analyzing feedback from alumni, external examiners, industry experts, and parents during my RAIT summer internship.
This system facilitates data-driven decision making by faculty, ultimately leading to enhanced student performance and curriculum alignment with industry needs.
